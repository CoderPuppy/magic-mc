## Planned Features

**Unlock System**

**Magical Energy:**

- somehow using too much can kill you
- no way to directly check how much you have, but you can figure out when you're low though
- max safe power - get close to or above this and bad stuff will happen (that will destroy all your stuff)
- natural power - power level gravitates to this

**Instability in Casting:**

- excess energy released if there is no target
- upgrade to reduce it

**Magical Entities:**

- demon, elf, fairy, pixie, wizard, mage, witch
- can be bound to your will / bidding to execute passive spells
- bind them to armor/yourself to get abilities

**Passive Spells:**

- able to block damage
- when something do something else
- needs a magical force, either you or a bound magical entity

**Upgrade System:**

- find info then use the spell on low levels
- do similar spells and you might learn about it
